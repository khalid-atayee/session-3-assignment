                    Invest into people who will transform the world by leading boldly, programming communicatively, and writing insightful posts that inspire peers and internet passers alike.
                    I know that this vision may change in the future, and I may not always have the energy and excitement as I originally had for the vision. But I hope that it will be something I can look to remind myself what I'm doing and why I'm doing it, bringing about a greater intentionality over everything I pursue after.</p>
